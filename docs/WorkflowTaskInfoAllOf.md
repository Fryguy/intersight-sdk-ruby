## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **class_id** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to &#39;workflow.TaskInfo&#39;] |
| **object_type** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to &#39;workflow.TaskInfo&#39;] |
| **description** | **String** | The task description and this is the description that was added when the task was included into the workflow. | [optional][readonly] |
| **end_time** | **Time** | The time stamp when the task reached a final state. | [optional][readonly] |
| **failure_reason** | **String** | Description of the reason why the task failed. | [optional][readonly] |
| **input** | **Object** | The input data that was sent to the task at the start of execution. | [optional][readonly] |
| **inst_id** | **String** | The instance ID of the task running in the workflow engine. | [optional][readonly] |
| **internal** | **Boolean** | Denotes whether or not this is an internal task.  Internal tasks will be hidden from the UI within a workflow. | [optional][readonly] |
| **label** | **String** | User friendly short label to describe this task instance in the workflow. | [optional][readonly] |
| **message** | [**Array&lt;WorkflowMessage&gt;**](WorkflowMessage.md) |  | [optional] |

| **running_inst_id** | **String** | The instance ID of the task that is currently being executed. When retrying a workflow with failed tasks, the task in workflow engine will have a new instance ID, but the task may still be in-progress. In this case, the task instId reflects the instance ID in the workflow engine, while runningInstId reflects the instance ID of the instance that is currently being executed. | [optional][readonly] |
| **start_time** | **Time** | The time stamp when the task started execution. | [optional][readonly] |
| **status** | **String** | The status of the task and this will specify if the task is running or has reached a final state. | [optional] |
