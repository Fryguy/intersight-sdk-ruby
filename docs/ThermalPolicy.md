# IntersightClient::ThermalPolicy

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **class_id** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to &#39;thermal.Policy&#39;] |
| **object_type** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to &#39;thermal.Policy&#39;] |
| **fan_control_mode** | **String** | Sets the Fan Control Mode of the System. High Power, Maximum Power and Acoustic modes are only supported for Cisco UCS X series Chassis. * &#x60;Balanced&#x60; - The fans run faster when needed based on the heat generated by the server. When possible, the fans returns to the minimum required speed. * &#x60;LowPower&#x60; - The Fans run at the minimum speed required to keep the server cool. * &#x60;HighPower&#x60; - The fans are kept at higher speed to emphasizes performance over power consumption. This Mode is only supported for UCS X series Chassis. * &#x60;MaximumPower&#x60; - The fans are always kept at maximum speed. This option provides the most cooling and consumes the most power. This Mode is only supported for UCS X series Chassis. * &#x60;Acoustic&#x60; - The fan speed is reduced to reduce noise levels in acoustic-sensitive environments. This Mode is only supported for UCS X series Chassis. | [optional][default to &#39;Balanced&#39;] |
| **organization** | [**OrganizationOrganizationRelationship**](OrganizationOrganizationRelationship.md) |  | [optional] |
| **profiles** | [**Array&lt;PolicyAbstractConfigProfileRelationship&gt;**](PolicyAbstractConfigProfileRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources. | [optional] |
