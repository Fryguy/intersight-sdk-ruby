| **class_id** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to &#39;vnic.FcInterruptSettings&#39;] |
| **object_type** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to &#39;vnic.FcInterruptSettings&#39;] |
