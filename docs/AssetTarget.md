| **management_location** | **String** | The location from which Intersight manages the target. * &#x60;Unknown&#x60; - The management mechanism is not detected. Unknown is used as a default by the implementation and is not an allowed user input. * &#x60;Intersight&#x60; - Management of a target is performed directly from Intersight. Network connections are established from Intersight to a management interface of the Target and authenticated using user provided credentials. * &#x60;IntersightAssist&#x60; - Management of a target is performed via a selected Intersight Assist. Network connections are established from the Intersight Assist to a management interface of the Target. * &#x60;DeviceConnector&#x60; - An Intersight Device Connector running within the Target establishes a connection to Intersight and management of the target is performed via this connection. | [optional][default to &#39;Unknown&#39;] |
| **name** | **String** | A user provided name for the managed target. | [optional] |
| **product_id** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** |  | [optional] |
| **read_only** | **Boolean** | For targets which are managed by an embedded Intersight Device Connector, this field indicates that an administrator of the target has disabled management operations of the Device Connector and only monitoring is permitted. | [optional][readonly] |
| **services** | [**Array&lt;AssetService&gt;**](AssetService.md) |  | [optional] |
| **status** | **String** | Status indicates if Intersight can establish a connection and authenticate with the managed target. Status does not include information about the functional health of the target. * &#x60;&#x60; - The target details have been persisted but Intersight has not yet attempted to connect to the target. * &#x60;Connected&#x60; - Intersight is able to establish a connection to the target and initiate management activities. * &#x60;NotConnected&#x60; - Intersight is unable to establish a connection to the target. * &#x60;ClaimInProgress&#x60; - Claim of the target is in progress. A connection to the target has not been fully established. * &#x60;Unclaimed&#x60; - The device was un-claimed from the users account by an Administrator of the device. Also indicates the failure to claim Targets of type HTTP Endpoint in Intersight. * &#x60;Claimed&#x60; - Target of type HTTP Endpoint is successfully claimed in Intersight. Currently no validation is performed to verify the Target connectivity from Intersight at the time of creation. However invoking API from Intersight Orchestrator fails if this Target is not reachable from Intersight or if Target API credentials are incorrect. | [optional][readonly][default to &#39;&#39;] |
